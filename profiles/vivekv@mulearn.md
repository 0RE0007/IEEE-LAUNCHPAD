| **SoilQMS**  |        Developed a system capable of real-time monitoring of soil quality using va-
                        rious sensors.
                        Enables continuous data collection and analysis to ensure optimal conditions
                        for crop growth.
                        Implemented a feature to provide crop-specific recommendations based on sensor
                        readings. Utilizes data from sensors to suggest actions such as adjusting 
                        watering schedules or applying fertilizers, enhancing crop yield and health.
                        Designed functionality for users to manually input nutrient values such as 
                        Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (N, P, K) into the system.By comparing this 
                        values it gives required amount of nutrients for the optimal growth of crops | [Hosted Link 2](https://github.com/vvk-droid/SoilQMS.git)| [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/vvk-droid/SoilQMS.git)             |
