### About Me

As a BCA graduate with a passion for technology and fitness, I thrive on the intersection of code and dumbbells. 🚀 Here’s a glimpse into my professional journey:

🌟 Tech Enthusiast: I’m currently pursuing a Python Full Stack internship, where I’m diving deep into web development, databases, APIs and Machine Learning. From front-end design to back-end logic, I’m all about turning ideas into functional applications.

🏢 Business Mindset: Beyond coding, I’m actively involved in my father’s business, where I’ve learned valuable lessons about strategy, customer relations, and problem-solving. Balancing tech innovation with real-world business challenges keeps me on my toes.

💡 Problem Solver: Whether it’s debugging a tricky piece of code or optimizing a business process, I thrive on finding elegant solutions. My motto: “Every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow.”

🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Fanatic: When I’m not typing away at my keyboard, you’ll find me at the gym, lifting weights and chasing those endorphins. Fitness isn’t just a hobby; it’s a lifestyle that fuels my productivity and creativity.
