### About Me

Hey there!I'm Karun Chery James, a final year Computer Science Engineering student at SJCET Palai, known for my talent, ambition, and diligent work ethic in the tech sphere.

Notably, I was part of the team ranked among the top 30 in the WOW Hackathon, a prestigious competition by Google Developer Student Clubs as part of GDSC WOW Kerala 2023.

In addition to my technical skills, I'm well-versed in tools such as Canva, Figma, and GitHub, leveraging them to enhance collaboration and streamline workflows. My knack for multitasking, problem-solving, and fostering collaboration ensures successful outcomes in every endeavor.
