## Portfolio Highlights

### My Projects

| Name                | Description                                                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **WSL2 FORENSICS**  | Explored the detection, acquisition, and postmortem analysis of WSL2 instances, including identifying WSL2 guests and automating the investigation process, challenges and considerations in incident handling and computer forensics related to integrating the Windows Subsystem for Linux, version 2 (WSL2), into Microsoft’s operating systems.                                              | 
| **MERN STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT**  | Developed a single‑page web application utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and essential web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project encompasses the creation of a user‑friendly Sign‑up and Login Page, ensuring secure authentication processes. Additionally, implemented an Issue Tracker functionality within the application, enabling seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficient issue management.                                             |
| **AI for Cybersecurity**  | Semantic Analysis and Classification of emails through informative selection of features and ensemble AI model.                          |
| **A NOVEL HYBRID ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUE FOR DATABASE**  | The approach integrates substitution and transposition methods for enhanced data protection. Key generation involves three substitution keys (k1, k2, k3) and an additional transposition key (k4). The input text is converted to ASCII codes in the encryption process, forming a square matrix
and applying substitution and transposition operations using the designated keys. Notably, the matrix is rearranged column‑wise based on key k4. The encrypted output, or cipher, is obtained by converting modified ASCII values back to characters. This solution contributes to a more secure data encryption process, combining the strengths of substitution and transposition methodologies.
