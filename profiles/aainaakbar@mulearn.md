| **Pesonal Dermatologist**        |The personal dermatologist aimed to classify 10 classes of diseases using a machine learning model trained with three distinct networks: ResNet50, DenseNet, and VGG16 .The training, conducted in Google Colab, utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Post-training, the model was integrated into a full-stack application. The frontend, built with HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS, was complemented by a Flask-based backend. Additionally, the Gemini API was integrated to provide users with detailed information on symptoms, cures, and prevention measures once a disease was detected. The development was carried out in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), ensuring a robust and user-friendly application.                                                 | [Personal Dermatologist(Not hosted)](https://github.com/aaina942/skindieseasedetection.git) |[github repo link]([Personal Dermatologist](https://github.com/aaina942/skindieseasedetection.git)  |
| **Skin disease detection using mobileNet V2**        | The project leverages MobileNetV2 neural networks to develop a model for identifying and assessing three  specific skin disorders: Eczema, Acne Pustular and Melasma. Achieving an impressive testing accuracy of 95% and a validation accuracy of 74.02%.

Training was conducted in Google Colab, providing a robust environment for iterative development. The system not only identifies skin disorders but also assesses the progression or improvement of the affected areas by quantifying grayscale values in uploaded images. This real-time assessment helps users and medical professionals monitor treatment effectiveness, acknowledging improvements or noting the absence .   | [SkinDiseaseDetection](https://github.com/aaina942/personaldermatologist))     | [github repo link](SkinDiseaseDetection](https://github.com/aaina942/personaldermatologist) |
| **Drowsiness Detection**        |In this project, I use OpenCV to capture images from a webcam and feed them into a deep learning model to classify whether a person’s eyes are ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’. The process involves capturing an image, detecting the face to create a Region of Interest (ROI), and then detecting the eyes from the ROI. These eye images are fed into a classifier that categorizes them as open or closed. I built the model with Keras using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which excels in image classification. It includes an input layer, an output layer, and multiple hidden layers where convolution operations with filters are performed. The system also calculates a score to determine drowsiness.| [Drowsiness Detection(Not hosted)](https://github.com/aaina942/drowsinessdetection) |[github repo link]([Drowsiness Detection]((https://github.com/aaina942/drowsinessdetection))  |
