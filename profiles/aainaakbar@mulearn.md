| **Pesonal Dermatologist**        |The personal dermatologist aimed to classify 10 classes of diseases using a machine learning model trained with three distinct networks: ResNet50, DenseNet, and VGG16 .The training, conducted in Google Colab, utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Post-training, the model was integrated into a full-stack application. The frontend, built with HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS, was complemented by a Flask-based backend. Additionally, the Gemini API was integrated to provide users with detailed information on symptoms, cures, and prevention measures once a disease was detected. The development was carried out in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), ensuring a robust and user-friendly application.                                                 | [Personal Dermatologist(Not hosted)](https://github.com/aaina942/skindieseasedetection.git) |[github repo link]([Personal Dermatologist(Not hosted)](https://github.com/aaina942/skindieseasedetection.git)  |
