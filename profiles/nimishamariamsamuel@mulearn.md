#### Career Plan:

I aim to kickstart interactive workshops and knowledge-sharing sessions for tech entrepreneurs in Kerala, covering ideation, market validation, fundraising, and scaling. Collaborating with industry leaders and government bodies, I'll advocate for policies that incentivize startups and facilitate access to funding and incubation programs. By fostering collaboration and providing resources, I'll empower local talent and cultivate a vibrant startup community.

Looking ahead, I envision Kerala as a global hub for tech innovation. Specialized tech parks and innovation hubs will offer infrastructure, mentorship, and networking, attracting talent, investors, and partnerships. Initiatives like coding boot camps and entrepreneurship education will nurture an entrepreneurial culture, creating a pipeline of innovators who will drive Kerala's Technology Startup Ecosystem to international prominence. Together, we'll unlock Kerala's full potential in tech and innovation.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has immense potential to excel in the Technology Startup Ecosystem, and my vision for its future success is rooted in innovation, collaboration, and a supportive ecosystem. Firstly, fostering a culture of innovation from grassroots levels, including schools and universities, can ignite a passion for problem-solving and entrepreneurship among the youth. Initiatives like coding boot camps, hackathons, and mentorship programs can cultivate a generation of tech-savvy innovators ready to take on global challenges.

Secondly, establishing specialized tech parks and innovation hubs equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure and resources will attract top talent and investors. These hubs can serve as hotbeds for collaboration, knowledge exchange, and cross-industry partnerships, driving rapid innovation and growth. Additionally, creating a regulatory environment that encourages experimentation and rewards risk-taking will fuel the emergence of disruptive startups and technologies.

Furthermore, promoting diversity and inclusivity within the startup ecosystem by supporting women and underrepresented communities in tech entrepreneurship can unlock untapped talent and perspectives, leading to more innovative solutions. Collaborations between startups, academia, and established companies can also foster a dynamic ecosystem where ideas flow freely, collaborations thrive, and success stories inspire the next wave of entrepreneurs.

By focusing on these pillars—innovation culture, infrastructure, regulatory support, diversity, and collaboration—Kerala can position itself as a global leader in the Technology Startup Ecosystem, driving economic growth, job creation, and transformative solutions that benefit society at large. Together, we can harness Kerala's rich talent pool, entrepreneurial spirit, and unique strengths to create a thriving tech ecosystem that paves the way for a brighter and more innovative future.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

My open-source contributions reflect my passion for collaboration, innovation, and giving back to the community. I have actively contributed to both my own projects and as well as for my colleague's projects, aiming to create impactful solutions and drive positive change.
I've had the chance to collaborate with my two teams to do my academic mini-project and main project respectively. As an active team player, I've significantly contributed to the success of the project. I've also got the opportunity to help my colleagues to complete their projects as well. Due to my adeptness at adapting to new situations and my commitment to continuous learning, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of a Timetable Generator website for the IT department at Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology.
